# 🚀 SwagLabs Login Tester 🚀

Welcome to the SwagLabs Login Tester! This project is all about testing various logins for the fake shop "SwagLabs" on the website saucedemo.com. 🛍️

## 🎯 What does it do? 🎯

This project runs a series of tests on different user logins. Some of these tests are designed to fail, because we believe in learning from our mistakes! 🧪💥

## 📊 Cool Graphics 📊

One of the best parts of this project is that it can generate graphics of where and when the tests have failed. This gives us a visual representation of our test results, making it easier to understand what's going on. 📈📉

## 🤖 Automation with Jenkins 🤖

But that's not all! These tests are also automated to run in Jenkins. This means less manual work for us, and more consistent and reliable testing. 🔄💻
